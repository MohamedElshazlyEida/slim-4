# Requirement:
## First Part:
Develop a complete server/client example showcasing the use of RESTful APIs.
The example could be based on managing a user's data as an example.
## Second Part:
Create two additional tables with random generated data linked to the user tables (an
example would be transactions and locations), ensure that at least one of them has 100k+
records, and provide an API that would query based on the two tables (example, total
transactions for a given date in a location) + the user table to fetch a result.

## Back End:
Apache / PHP8 Server with Slim 4 Framework installed.
## Front End:
Web Front End using jQuery or VueJS.
## Database:
MySQL Database
## Additional Notes:
The task's objective is simple, feel free to create the tables as you see fit for a production
deployment. The objective for us is to ensure you can apply your own concepts in a
coherent manner that can be reflected in the code you provide.

# Key Assessment Areas:
1. Code structure, organization and documentation
2. Example thoroughness
3. Validation
4. Security Considerations
5. Database optimization for performance.
